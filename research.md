## Research Experience 🔭

_Jan. 2022 - July 2022_   **[Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris](https://www.iap.fr)**  <br>
Investigating how low-mass satellite galaxies lose their ability to form stars (i.e., quench) while joining a new cluster by tracing forward in time their evolution from (z=1 to z=0), and exploring the possible quenching mechanisms (e.g., ram pressure stripping, AGN feedback)

 - Supervised by:  Dr. Gary Mamon
 - Master Thesis title: Who turned the lights off? And when?: Quenching insights in IllustrisTNG
 - Relevant Skills: Theoretical, Computational, and Analytical  Modelling

_Jan. 2021- Aug. 2021_   **[Max-Planck-Institut für Astronomie](https://www.mpia.de/en) & [Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris](https://www.iap.fr)**  <br>
Predicting the fraction of  supermassive black holes and active galactic nuclei in nearby dwarf galaxies using six different cosmological simulations (Horizon-AGN, EAGLE, SIMBA, Illustris, TNG100 and TNG300).
